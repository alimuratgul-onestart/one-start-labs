            Do you have a referral program?

            advantage of the referral program, the new customer must use the Contact Us (link) form on the website and

            How often will you reconcile my inventory?
        </p>
        <p class="subheader">
            Initially, we do an historic, 18 month look-back of your inventory. Once that inventory has been fully
            reconciled and refunded, we set you up for bi-annual reviews, unless you request a different frequency. We
            will always reach out to you for re-authorization to reconcile your account prior to starting a review.

            The fee for our service will be 30% of refunds recovered by our team.
